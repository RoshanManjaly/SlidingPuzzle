 * Junit test cases for SimplePuzzleState implementation of PuzzleState
 * interface. Class contains a number of black box tests. Test scenario: 4x4
 * board with 1 empty slot Sequence of moves: down, right, right and then
 * reversed as left, left, up such that cycle back to starting state is closed.
 * 
 * Warning 1: the setUp method performs calls to setToInitialState() and move()
 * which must be implemented to pass even the most basic tests. If code fails
 * already in setUp method, make it pass test cases in
 * SimplePuzzleStateBasicsTest before working on the more rigid ones here.
 * 
 * Warning 2: the tests use the SimplePuzzleState.equals() method, which must be
 * implemented as well as the hashcode() method. We assume the following notion
 * of equality: two states are equal if the tiles on the board are of equal
 * value on all positions. Parent, path length or operation do not matter for
 * equality.
